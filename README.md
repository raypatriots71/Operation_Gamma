### Purpose
The world exists as an object. You are the physical existence of a prototype, with properties, and then an instance of that. You have your own methods, your own thoughts, your unique things that make you, YOU. The purpose of this programming language is to bind objects together and everything is maintained as an object. Everything is assumed to be returned, dynamic, and free-flowing.
#### Theory
To preface the theory, everything in this language is built on returning the object to the parent. Using multiple operators between a, and a ```,```, the operators are executed from right to left, but following math rules. This comes from the postfix view of operators, while math operands expect to work the way of classic order of operations. This language exists solley to map parents and children, and tag variables. Every line of functional code is kept within a ```()```, while anything outside after ```.``` are variable names of the objects above them. The property is then the variable. 

### Basic Syntax
```
/* comments */
// inline comments
```
##### Basic Operators
```
+ addition
- subtraction
% modulo
/ division
^ exponential

. Of
_ Function
, Chaining
{} Conditional
= Equal  
; Apply
```
##### If Else statement
```
{Conditional}(True Statement);().(False Statement)
```
##### Loops
```
For loop:
[ *anything* to *anything* ](rest of the loop)
[ declaration; ](rest of the loop)

While loop:
[*anything* < conditional](rest of the loop)
```
##### Declarative Keywords
```
In 
    - function declaration
_
    - .constructor()
    - constructor 
; 
    - {}() ; ()._() - TRUE ; FALSE
    - override + apply to previous
lib::
    - library declaration and usage
[meet true operator]
    - if something is within [], it'll loop until true
    - while loop vibes
ret
    - Return upwards on call
        - can return constructor
        - can return method
del 
	- Deletes a variable from a memory
```

### Basic Usage

#### Variable Declaration Methods:
##### Only for numerical literals
```
x.(1) is logically equivalent to x.1
x.(1) Works as the first property of the x, ie x == now
x.1 is the declarative of the first property of x
```
##### Variable Name Declaration
```
x.foo.1 <- x's variable foo maintains the value of 1
x.(foo) auto defaults to variable
x.("foo") is a string
x.foo is not a string
x."foo" will still be a string

xx is its own variable

del removes a variable from memory
    - usage del xx
```
##### Function Usage
-> Sends most recent node into function downwards, then up. 
```
// Function Usage
In add(a,b)._( a + b) //declaring an add function, as shown used above
In square(a)._( a*a)
In mult( a, b )._(a*b)  

X.(2,3)-> add // X=5


```
### Example Code
###### If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```
In run._(
    sum.0, [i.(0 to 1000)](
        {i%3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0}
            sum += i
    )
    ret sum
)
```
###### Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```
In run._(
    sum.0,
    x.1,              // Represents the current Fibonacci number being processed
    y.2,              // Represents the next Fibonacci numbe rin the sequence
    [x <= 4000000](
        {x%2 == 0}(
            sum += x,
            z.(x+y),
            x = y,
            y = z
        )
    ret sum
    )
)
```
